# Web Scraping and API Integration with Python

## Project Overview

This project is a Python-based solution for web scraping and local API integration, crafted to extract data from [BooksToSprape](https://books.toscrape.com/) and engage with external APIs. Whether you aim to collect information from web pages or communicate with external services, this project offers a straightforward example. As my inaugural API, I am committed to enhancing my understanding to optimize its functionality and appearance.
